                <p>By day, I change diapers and write essays and design products and answer emails. I speak at international events, say another prayer, brew another coffee. By day I travel the world, or at least the grocery. I read another chapter and kiss another skinned knee and battle another bad habit. I fry bacon. I change my outfit. I refill my husband’s water glass and then style lookbooks and sing lullabies and search for that ubiquitous missing sock yet again.</p>
                <p>By night, I write it all down here.</p>
                <p>Author of Chasing Slow and founder of international homeschooling co-op Other Goose, Erin Loechner has been writing online for two decades now. Her heartfelt words and design work have been showcased in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Parenting Magazine, Huffington Post, and a two-season HGTV.com web special, garnering over one million fans worldwide. She has spoken for and appeared in renowned international events for clients such as Walt Disney World, IKEA, and Martha Stewart. Now nestled in a Midwestern town, Erin, her husband, and kids strive for less in most areas except three: joy, grace, and pickles.</p>
