            <h4>1.CREATE A HEALTHY HABIT</h4>
            <p>Starting any kind of fitness or health journey begins with forming lasting habits and routines that eventually transition into a lifestyle. <strong>The best way to form any kind of habit is to start small.</strong>This could mean getting up at a certain time every day or simply preparing a nutritious lunch. Once you nail down one habit, you can begin to tack on more until you have a routine.  Many people also find that something as simple as scheduling their workouts in the morning helps set them up for the rest of the day. Once they accomplish their first task of getting in a good sweat, they feel like they're able to take on the rest of their to-do list.</p>
            <h4>2.INCREASE 'FEEL GOOD' ENDORPHINS</h4>
            <p>It’s a well-known fact that exercise helps increase <i>endorphins</i>. Endorphins are one of the many benefits of exercise that have nothing to do with your physical appearance.Endorphins can help improve your mood, boost your energy and reduce anxiety and depression. It’s no wonder that everyone is always chasing that endorphin high.</p>
            <h4>3.SLEEP BETTER</h4>
            <p>Physical activity can help all aspects of the sleep cycle: you’ll fall asleep faster, deepen your sleep and feel more rested when you wake up.All physical activity is helpful, but <span>Yoga is particularly good for its bedtime benefits. </span> study found that 150 minutes of physical activity per week–which works out to about 20 minutes a day–can improve sleep quality by up to 65 per cent.</p>
            <h4>4.IMPROVE YOUR CONFIDENCE</h4>
            <p>Sometimes we underestimate ourselves and assume we won't be able to accomplish the goals that we set, but that isn't the case. If you start small and stick to your workouts, you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. <span>So, if you’re starting a workout routine, be sure to set some attainable goals for yourself.</span> The pride that comes from accomplishing your fitness goals can drastically boost your confidence, giving you the push you need to continue on your journey</p>
